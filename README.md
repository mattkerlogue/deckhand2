`{deckhand2}` is an extension to the `{pagedown}` package that uses the
CSS grid layout module to provide extensive layout control of page based
R Markdown reports, such as when creating slide decks.

## In development

This package is currently under development and not yet ready for
general use. You can track general progress in the lead [GH
issue](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/deckhand2/issues/1).

## History, purpose & acknoweldgements

`{deckhand2}` is a generalised successor to the `{deckhand}` package
that I developed when working at the Cabinet Office. Individuals working
in other institutions have started to use that package, forking it and
making relevant adaptations for their own organisational set-up. Thus
{deckhand2} is intended as a successor to the {deckhand} that provides a
more generalised approach for working with CSS grid-layout and the
underlying paged media framework provided by {pagedown}.
